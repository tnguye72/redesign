      <h1>Responsive Redesign</h1>
      
      
      <p> <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <img id="screenshot" src=screenshot.png alt="screenshot of website to be redesigned"> 
        This is a project for CS1300: User Interface and Experience at Brown University, in which I redesign an existing webpage based on usability standards. I will analyze and identify flaws in an existing interface, create low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for various screen sizes, and build a responsive website based on those prototypes.
        <br>
        <br>
        I have chosen to redesign the home page of a local Rhode Island soap business: <a href="http://seafoamtradingco.com/">Newport Sea Foam Trading Co.</a> A screen shot of the homeage is shown.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Identifying Problems</h2>
        I analyzed the usability of the website using the criteria we learned about in class: usability, learnability, and memorabilty. My findings are shown here:
        <br>
        <div class="table-responsive">
        <table class="table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th class="col-title" scope="col">Usability</th>
              <th class="col-title" scope="col">Learnability</th>
              <th class="col-title" scope="col">Memorability</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td> <b>Disorganization</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>The disorganized nav bar makes it difficult for a user to find what they’re looking for. 
                  </li>
                  <li>Contact info seems to be arbitrarily placed in the body of the page when it is already provided at the bottom. 
                  </li>
                </ul>
                
              </td>
              <td> <b>Unclear Navigation</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>The nav bar fails to categorize different pages and instead conglomerates all the links into one bar. 
                  </li>
                  <li>This rather long and disorganized nav bar makes it difficult for users to find what they’re looking for by category, especially if they are first-time users of the site.

                  </li>
                </ul>
              </td>
              <td><b>Lack of Visual Distinction</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    In addition to its many components, the nav bar has buttons that look identical (same font, same color, same size), despite them being in different categories. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Without some distinguishing feature or category, users may find it difficult to remember which button they clicked to go to a specific page.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><b>Readability</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>The pitch at the top of the page, “Artisan. Natural. From the Heart of Newport, RI. Enjoy the Foam!!” is difficult to read due to the light font, which may pose a problem for older users or those with visual impairments
                  </li>
                  <li>The contact info at the bottom of the page is arbitrarily spaced as well as inconsistently formatted.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </td>
              <td>  <b>Lack of Clarity</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The name of the website “Newport Sea Foam Trading” is contained within a relatively small image at the center of the screen.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Therefore, at first glance, it’s not clear what website you’re on. 
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </td>
              <td><b>Lack of Spatial Distinction</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The nav bar buttons are placed in the same general area without any categorization.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Therefore, users would have a difficult time remembering where exactly they clicked to go to a certain page.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td> <b>Convenience</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>The contact info at the bottom does not provide a link that opens up an email window for convenience. 
                  </li>
                  <li>Instead, the user has to copy and paste the email address, which may be a small but preventable inconvenience.</li>
                </ul>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
      </p>
      <h2>Accessibility Findings</h2>
      <p>
        <b>WebAIM WAVE:</b> When I inserted the website into WebAIM WAVE, the main alerts that were found involved the images that are displayed on the home page. The images have suspicious alternative text, and when I checked what the alternative text was, I found that the alt text was not very informative. They were all the same, with the words “Newport Sea Foam Trading Co”, except differentiated with an image number. This may provide accessibility issues, as people using screen readers would not be able to understand what the image is specifically showing.
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Testing on a Screenreader:</b> I used VoiceOver on Mac to test how it interacts with the site, and it was consistent with the problems I found on WebAIM Wave, which was that the alternative text was not very descriptive. Therefore, it is confusing what the images are showing. 
      </p>

        <h2>Testing for Responsiveness:
        </h2>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I used Developer Tools to test what the site looks like on other devices as well as different screen sizes, and it seems that the design is indeed responsive. It is still able to be used across different devices.
            </li>
            <li>
              I changed the font size on my Mac to see what the site would look like, and the site is still usable with large as well as smaller font sizes.
            </li>

            <li>
              I tested the redesigned site on WebAIM Wave, and it seems that the design is indeed more accessible. Compared to the original, which threw many errors for suspicious alt text, the alt text for the images on the new site were listed as features. The only errors I got were included empty links, which is to be expected for this assignment.
            </li>
